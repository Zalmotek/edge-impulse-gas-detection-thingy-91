## The challenge

Traditional gas detection systems based on point sensors have several limitations.Spatial density, Network coverage and the need of human intervention to evaluate the data and take action reduce the performance of said systems and decrease their ability to detect and take early preventive measures in case of a gas leak.

## The solution
To overcome those challenges, we propose a solution based on the Nordic Semi Thingy:91  an IoT multi-sensor device, equipped with an environmental sensor suite, LTE connectivity and full compatibility with Edge Impulse machine learning models.

## Conclusion

A system built around the  Nordic Thingy:91 and Edge Impulse platform is a great way to overcome some of the challenges associated with traditional gas detection systems. By using it as an edge device, it can measure the gas concentration, run a machine learning algorithm and decide if there is a trend in the quantity of dangerous gasses in the air and act out without human intervention. Additionally, by using it as a wearable, it will be able to detect gas leakages in the proximity of the employees that wear it, ensuring that they are not exposed to dangerous agents.
